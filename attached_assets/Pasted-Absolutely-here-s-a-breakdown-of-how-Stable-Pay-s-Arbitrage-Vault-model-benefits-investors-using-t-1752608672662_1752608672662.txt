Absolutely — here’s a breakdown of how Stable Pay’s Arbitrage Vault model benefits investors using the stablecoin premium strategy between offshore and Indian markets.

⸻

💡 What Is Stablecoin Arbitrage?

Stablecoin arbitrage in the context of Stable Pay involves capturing the premium between USD stablecoins (USDT/USDC) and their INR off-ramp value in the Indian market. This premium ranges from 0.5% to 2.5%+, depending on liquidity, compliance, and demand/supply across P2P or exchange markets.

Stable Pay operates under an FIU-IND compliant, self-custody model to ensure transparent, regulatory-aligned participation while giving investors exposure to this price delta.

🔁 How Stable Pay Arbitrage Vault Works

🔄 Flow Summary:
	1.	User deposits USDC/USDT on supported chains (ETH, BSC, Solana, etc.)
	2.	Funds are routed to onchain vaults visible on Stable Pay’s Vault Explorer
	3.	Stable Pay’s backend aggregates:
	•	INR on-ramp demand (from Indian users)
	•	Stablecoin liquidity supply (from vault capital)
	4.	The system captures arbitrage premium by facilitating compliant INR settlements to Indian users via FIU-IND supervised channels
	5.	Vault investors receive yield every 15 days based on performance from these arbitrage cycles
